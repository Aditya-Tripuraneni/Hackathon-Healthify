## üí° Inspiration

Its hard to keep track of your fitness goals and how you are doing. We are really busy and don't have time to write down all of your workouts. We are also not able to keep track of your progress or the calories you have consumed. Not taking proper care of your body is a big problem. We are here to help you keep track of your fitness goals and how you are doing. Healthify is your daily health app where you can track your daily workouts, and weight, which are shown in the form of graphs for better understanding. In addition to these features, you can also search for nearby gyms & pharmacies and anything else that will help you achieve your fitness goals.
