                    <li>Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees slightly as you push your butt way back. Keeping
                        your back flat, slowly lower the weight along your shins. </li>
                    <li>Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.</li>
                    <li>Keeping your core engaged, push through your heels to stand up straight and return to the

                    <li>Keep the weight close to your shins as you pull up.</li>

                        position.</li>
                    <li>Squeeze your glutes and abs, and push through your heels to lift your hips a few inches off the
                        floor, until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.</li>

                    <li>Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your arms at your
                        sides.
                    <li>With your core engaged, hinge forward at the hips, pushing your butt back. Bend your knees and
                        make sure you don’t round your shoulders. (Your hip mobility and hamstring flexibility will
                        dictate how far you can bend over.)</li>
                    <li>Gaze at the ground a few inches in front of your feet to keep your neck in a comfortable,
                        neutral position.</li>
                    <li>Perform a row by pulling the weights up toward your chest, keeping your elbows close to your
                        body, and squeezing your shoulder blades for 2 seconds at the top of the movement. Your elbows
                        should go past your back as you bring the weight toward your chest.

                        to your ears.
                        Contract your abs to press your lower back into the ground.</li>
                    <li>Point your toes, squeeze your thighs together, squeeze your glutes, and lift your legs off the
                        ground.</li>
                    <li>Lift your shoulders off the ground and keep your head in a neutral position so that you’re not
                        straining your neck. </li>
                    <li>Your legs and mid-back should both be off the floor, and you should be in the shape of a banana,
                        with just your lower back and hips on the ground.</li>
                    Hold this position for as long as you can while maintaining proper form.</li>
